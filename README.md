# BAN400 - R Programming for Data Science Final Project

This is the final project for the course BAN 400 - R Programming for Data Science at NHH.

The project is about "cherry-picking" regressions, i.e. the process of picking the regression model that produces the desirable coefficient estimates to prove a certain point. In this assignment we are specifically regressing GDP
on several variables available in the dataset, running 10,000s of regressions with different combinations of explanatory variables to find a positive coefficient estimate for the dummy variable "socialist".

The project mainly tests R programming skills.
